# EX – 30 -STUDENTS MARK -TOTAL &AVERAGE USING STRUCURE

## AIM
Create a C program to calculate the total and average of student using structure.

## ALGORITHM 

Step 1: Start the program.
Step 2: Define a struct student with:
•	name: a character array (size 10) for the student's name (not used in the logic).
•	rollno: an integer for the student's roll number (also unused).
•	subject[5]: an array to store marks of 5 subjects.
•	total: an integer to store total marks.
Step 3: Declare an array s[2] of type struct student for 2 students. Also declare variables n, i, and j for input 
             and iteration.
Step 4: Input Loop (i = 0 to 1):
•	Read an integer n (but it's not used later — possibly intended for roll number or placeholder).
•	Loop j = 0 to 4:
o	Read 5 subject marks into s[i].subject[j].
Step 5: Total Marks Calculation Loop (i = 0 to 1):
•	Initialize s[i].total to 0.
•	Loop j = 0 to 4:
o	Add each subject mark to s[i].total.
Step 6: Override Total (Hardcoded):
•	Set s[0].total = 374;
•	Set s[1].total = 383;
           This step overwrites the computed totals. It seems like testing or hardcoded totals — unnecessary if you’re 
                 already calculating them.
Step 7: Output Loop (i = 0 to 1):
•	Print s[i].total for each student.
Step 8: End the program.
